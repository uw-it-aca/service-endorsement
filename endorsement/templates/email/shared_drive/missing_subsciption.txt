Hello,

This message is from PRT's periodic shared drive reconcilation process.  You
are receiving this message because you are identified as a PRT administrator.

PRT's most recent report of Google Share Drives indictes a shared drive:

    Name: {{drive_name}}
    Id: {{drive_id}}

requires a quota increase ({quota_correct}) beyond the subsidized limit,
but has no corresponding ITBill subscription.

PRT has declined to adjust the quota.

Manual intervention is likely required.

Best Wishes,
