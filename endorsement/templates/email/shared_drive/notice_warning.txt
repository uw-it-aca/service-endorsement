Hello,

You are receiving this email because you are identified as {%if drive.shared_drive.members.all.count > 1 %}a{% else %}the{% endif %} UW manager
of the Google Shared Drive named "{{drive.shared_drive.drive_name}}".

Google Shared Drives must be renewed once every {{lifetime}} days. If your Google
Shared Drive is not renewed within {{notice_time}} days from the date of this notice,
the Google Shared Drive and all data contained within it will be
permanently deleted.

To maintain this Google Shared Drive, at least one of the drive's managers
must renew it within {{notice_time}} days using the Provisioning Request Tool (PRT) at:

    https://provision.uw.edu/drives

As long as at least one of the drive's managers completes the renewal, the
Google Shared Drive will remain accessible for another {{lifetime}} days. If the above
Google Shared Drive is managed by multiple UW managers but it is not in
your list of drives up for renewal, another manager may have already
completed it.

If you have any questions, please visit our Knowledge Base article on Google Shared
Drives

Thank you,
