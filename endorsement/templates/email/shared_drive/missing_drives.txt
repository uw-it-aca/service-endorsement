Hello,

This message is from PRT's periodic shared drive reconcilation process.  You
are receiving this message because you are identified as a PRT administrator.

PRT's most recent report of Google Share Drives excluded {{missing_drive_count}} previously
report shared drives.

PRT's reconcile process shared drive deletion limit is {{missing_drive_threshold}}.

PRT has declined to remove any  shared drives from its database.

This situation may be the result of a trunctated shared drive report. If so,
the next report may .

If the missing drive count is the expected result, either adjust PRT's
configuration to account for the increase, or run the reconcile process
(reconcile_share_drives) by hand.

Best Wishes,
